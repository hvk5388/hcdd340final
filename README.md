# hcdd340final
Hello! You have found our final project for HCDD 340. This is a project where we build an app to store your recipies and grocery list all in one place.

## Installation
In order to run this project you need to install [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install). You can then download and open the code there and run it in an emulator. [This](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app) is a great tutorial to figure out how to run an emulator.
